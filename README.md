# 8-bit_logic_gate_computerV2

The 8-bit logic gate computer (V2) can be found here: https://circuitverse.org/users/13948/projects/8-bit-computer-simplified-v2  
It is recommended to (create an account and) fork the project, so that you can enter programs. (And it's a bit less laggy.)  
This version is still in the making.
